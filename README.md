# Adversarial-Domain-Adaptive-Autoencoders
It was a course project where we proposed to use autoencoders with adversarial penalty for domain adaptation.

To run the code we require three files: mnistm_data.pkl, model_weights(for inference) and labels.npy. -- All the required dependencies are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jB66kz_ZKxBhk7TTFrY567D0ZxnlFP-9?usp=sharing). Ensure to keep all the above mentioned dependencies in the same direcory of code.
